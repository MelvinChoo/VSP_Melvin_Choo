    "1. This behaviour is predictable because the true DGP is y = 1 + 3.14 * x + e, without a squared term for x. This implies that the squared term x_sq is not significant. Hence, this corresponds to the Lasso path for x_sq which shows that its coefficient reamins at zero as the value of alpha increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A low value will be chosen for cross validation. This is ideal as lower alpha values allow the model to retain the significant coefficients closer to their true values. On the other hand, too high an alpha value will increase the penalty. This causes significant coefficients to be reduced unnecessarily and move significant ones away from their true values. "
